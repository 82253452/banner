This is just a demo of an Angular2 calendar search app. It's only useful to show how to use Angular2.

To run it:

 - Clone this repo
 - `npm install -g http-server`
 - `cd angular2_calendar`
 - `npm install`
 - `http-server -c-1`
 - Go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser
 - Click the "Load" button.
 - Click the "Search all Month" button.

Note that this example does es6-to-es5 transpilation in the browser at runtime, so the initial page load is very slow as a result. Once it loads, things go quite fast.
